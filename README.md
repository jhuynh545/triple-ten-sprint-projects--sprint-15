Good Seed, a supermarket chain, seeks to ensure compliance with alcohol laws by preventing alcohol sales to underage customers. The goal is to evaluate whether Data Science can assist in automating age verification using computer vision methods. The task involves building and evaluating a model to determine a person's age from photographs.

Key Objectives:
Build a computer vision model capable of estimating a person's age from a photo.
Ensure the model is accurate enough to reliably identify underage individuals.
Evaluate the feasibility of deploying this solution in a real-world retail environment.

Deliverables:
A trained age-prediction model, evaluated on a test dataset.
Performance metrics, including accuracy, MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and classification thresholds.
A report outlining the model's feasibility for deployment, including challenges, limitations, and recommendations.
